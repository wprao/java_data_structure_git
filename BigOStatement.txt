Big "O" statement is used to show complexity of the program.
Such as "O(1)  O(log(n))  O(n)  O(n*log(n))  O(n^2)"

Linear searching time :  O(N)
Half searching time:     O(log(N))
No order array insert time:    O(1)
Order array insert time :  O(N)
No order array delete time:  O(N)
Order array delete time:   O(N)
